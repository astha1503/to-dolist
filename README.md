## About the Project
This To-Do List project was created to practice and improve my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills.  
It focuses on DOM manipulation, event handling, and using browser local storage to save data.  
Through this project, I learned how to:
- Dynamically create and update HTML elements with JavaScript.
- Use CSS for responsive and clean UI design.
- Store and retrieve data from `localStorage`.
